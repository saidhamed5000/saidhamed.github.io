This is a simple static single-page portfolio prepared for GitHub Pages.
**What to do after download:**
1. (Optional) Replace `CV.pdf` in root with your actual resume file.
2. Edit `index.html` to update any text or links you want to change.
3. Upload all files to your repository named `saidhamed.github.io` (root of repo).
4. Commit and push, then enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Source: main / root).
5. Wait a minute and open: `https://saidhamed.github.io`

**Files included:**
- index.html
- css/styles.css
- js/script.js

If you want me to push these files directly to your repo, provide a temporary collaborator access or let me guide you step-by-step.
